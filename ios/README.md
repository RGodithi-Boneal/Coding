***
###	No to Most of "Background App Refresh"
	"Settings"
		> "General"
			> "Background App Refresh"
				> Click "Background App Refresh" at the top > "Off"
						OR
				> Click "Background App Refresh" at the top > "On"
					> Turn ALL Apps to "Off"

	"Settings"
		> "General"

				> "Reduce Motion"
					> Turn ON: "Reduce Motion"

"Settings"
	> "General"

###	iPhone 7 and Up, Only =(	Compress photos & videos even more w/ 'HEIF' & 'HEVC'
	"Settings" > "Camera" > "Formats" > Select "High Efficiency"



***
###	Remove “Always Tracking” Location Services – Especially for Adds
	"Settings"
		> "Privacy"
			> "Location Services"
				> Try to keep remove any unnecessary "Always" items (replace with "While Using", where possible)
				> Check out "System Services" and at least kill "Location-Based Apple Ads" --- Check out the rest, including "Significant Locations"

###	Calibrating an iOS Battery
If your battery drops from ~30% charge to almost nothing (5%, 3%) in the blink of an eye, you should definitely recalibrate your battery via the guide, below. It does requires quite some time (up to a day) to drain your phone's battery completely, etc., but you just leave your phone lying around so you'll live
